# Post-CET Exploit Technology

This repository provides a collection of environments to explore post CET exploitation. The structure is as follows:

* ``tests`` -- contains two simple tests you can run to see if shadow stacks are enabled on Linux. ``tests/test_exec_shstk.c`` additionally tests if the _exec family_ syscalls disable shadow stacks.
* ``cfbending`` -- contains vulnerable programs where you can use Control-flow Bending attacks. Also provided are automated exploits for each program.
* ``dop`` -- contains a vulnerable program and an exploit for it, using Data-Oriented Programming.
* ``coop`` -- contains a vulnerable C++ program which can be exploited through COOP gadget chains. The exploit alongside it will achieve code execution through a chain of 2 COOP gadgets and a command injection.

If running on CET-enabled hardware and operating system, make sure you enable the corresponding GLIBC tunable:

```
$ source ./source_me.sh
# or you can do it yourself
$ export GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.cpu.hwcaps=SHSTK,IBT
```
